 This file provides guidance to the Cursor AI Code Editor
 on how to generate, refactor, and maintain code for your Hugo project.

Instructions:
  - Always add debug logs & comments in the code for easier debugging and reliability.
  - Every time you apply a rule, explicitly state the rule(s) in the output.
  - You may abbreviate the rule description to a single word or phrase (e.g., "debug" or "structure").
  - Include relevant triggers and actions to ensure the code editor follows these rules consistently.
  - Always use the rules of the theme that you are using in this project.

rules:
  - name: "debug-logs"
    description: >
      Whenever you generate or refactor code, add debug logs (e.g., console/log printouts)
      and explanatory comments to improve readability and ease of debugging.
    # Example usage:
    # - "Applying rule 'debug-logs' here to add console.log statements and inline comments."
    triggers: [ "generate-code", "refactor-code", "any-code-change" ]

  - name: "explicit-reference"
    description: >
      Always explicitly state which rule(s) you are applying in your output.
      This can be abbreviated or listed in brackets, but must be visible.
    # Example usage:
    # - "Applying rule 'explicit-reference' to mention the rule name in the output."

  - name: "no-secrets"
    description: >
      Avoid committing or exposing any sensitive data (API keys, tokens, passwords).
      Should any appear, redact them or keep them out of version control.
    # Example usage:
    # - "Applying rule 'no-secrets' to ensure no API keys are visible."

  - name: "hugo-structure"
    description: >
      Follow Hugoâ€™s standard project structure:
       - 'content/' for markdown files
       - 'layouts/' for templates
       - 'static/' for static assets
       - 'themes/<themeName>/' for your custom theme
      Add debug logs or comments whenever you create or move files.
    triggers: [ "create-content", "create-layouts", "create-static", "create-theme" ]

  - name: "theme-guidelines"
    description: >
      When working on the custom theme:
       - Keep partials in 'layouts/partials'
       - Place shortcodes in 'layouts/shortcodes'
       - Adhere to best practices for maintainability
      Always add debug logs & comments for clarity on logic or style changes.
    triggers: [ "theme", "partials", "shortcodes" ]

  - name: "config-management"
    description: >
      When editing the main Hugo config (config.toml/config.yaml/config.json), 
      maintain consistent formatting and add comments explaining changes.
      Ensure debug logs or version notes are included where relevant.
    triggers: [ "config", "settings", "configuration" ]

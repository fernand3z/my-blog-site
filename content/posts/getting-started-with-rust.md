## Why Rust?

Rust has been Stack Overflow's most loved programming language for several years running. Let's explore what makes it special.

### Memory Safety Without Garbage Collection

One of Rust's most notable features is its guarantee of memory safety without using a garbage collector. This is achieved through its ownership system:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1; // s1 is moved to s2
    // println!("{}", s1); // This would cause a compile error
    println!("{}", s2); // This works fine
}
```

### Zero-Cost Abstractions

Rust provides high-level features without runtime overhead:

```rust
// Iterator implementation that compiles to efficient machine code
let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let sum: i32 = numbers.iter()
                     .filter(|&n| n % 2 == 0)
                     .sum();
```

### Next Steps

To get started with Rust:
1. Install via rustup
2. Read the Rust Book
3. Practice with small projects

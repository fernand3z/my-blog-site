## Understanding AI Ethics

As AI systems become more prevalent, understanding their ethical implications is crucial.

### Common Bias Sources

1. Training Data Bias
2. Algorithm Bias
3. Interaction Bias
4. Confirmation Bias

### Example: Bias in Data

```python
# Example of potential bias in data preprocessing
import pandas as pd

def preprocess_data(df):
    # Removing certain demographics might introduce bias
    df = df[df['age'] > 18]
    
    # Income thresholds might affect different groups differently
    df = df[df['income'] > 50000]
    
    return df

# Better approach: Consider impact on different groups
def fair_preprocess(df):
    # Analyze impact across demographics
    demographics = df.groupby('demographic_group').agg({
        'age': 'mean',
        'income': 'mean'
    })
    
    # Adjust thresholds based on group characteristics
    return df
```

### Ethical Guidelines

1. Transparency
   - Document decisions
   - Explain algorithms
   - Share limitations

2. Fairness
   - Test across groups
   - Monitor outcomes
   - Regular audits

3. Accountability
   - Clear ownership
   - Impact assessment
   - Feedback loops

### Best Practices

- Diverse development teams
- Regular bias testing
- Clear documentation
- User feedback integration
- Continuous monitoring

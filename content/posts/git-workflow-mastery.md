## Git Workflow Strategies

Understanding Git workflows is crucial for effective team collaboration.

### Git Flow Overview

```bash
# Feature development
git checkout -b feature/new-feature develop
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
git push origin feature/new-feature

# Release preparation
git checkout -b release/1.0.0 develop
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Version 1.0.0"
```

### Common Workflows

1. Git Flow
   - master/main
   - develop
   - feature/*
   - release/*
   - hotfix/*

2. Trunk-Based Development
   - main branch
   - short-lived feature branches

### Advanced Git Commands

```bash
# Interactive rebase
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# Cherry-pick specific commits
git cherry-pick abc123

# Clean up local branches
git branch --merged | grep -v "\*" | xargs -n 1 git branch -d
```

### Best Practices

1. Write meaningful commit messages
2. Keep branches short-lived
3. Review before merging
4. Use conventional commits
5. Regular rebasing

Example conventional commit:
```bash
feat(api): add user authentication endpoint
fix(ui): resolve button alignment issue
docs(readme): update installation steps
```

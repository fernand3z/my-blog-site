## Cloud Native Fundamentals

Cloud native architecture is designed to take full advantage of cloud computing models.

### Key Principles

1. Microservices
2. Containers
3. DevOps
4. Continuous Delivery
5. Service Mesh

### Example Microservice

```yaml
# Docker Compose example
version: '3'
services:
  api:
    build: ./api
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - DB_HOST=db
    depends_on:
      - db
  
  db:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  db-data:
```

### Infrastructure as Code

```terraform
# Terraform example
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_eks_cluster" "main" {
  name     = "main-cluster"
  role_arn = aws_iam_role.eks_cluster.arn

  vpc_config {
    subnet_ids = var.subnet_ids
  }
}
```

### Best Practices

1. Design for failure
2. Implement health checks
3. Use managed services
4. Automate everything
5. Monitor and log extensively

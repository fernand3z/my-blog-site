## API Architecture Comparison

Let's explore the differences between GraphQL and REST APIs and when to use each.

### REST Example

Traditional REST endpoint structure:

```http
GET /api/users/123
GET /api/users/123/posts
GET /api/users/123/followers
```

Response:
```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

### GraphQL Example

Single endpoint with flexible queries:

```graphql
query {
  user(id: "123") {
    name
    email
    posts {
      title
      comments {
        text
      }
    }
    followers {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

### Key Differences

1. Data Fetching
   - REST: Multiple endpoints
   - GraphQL: Single endpoint

2. Over/Under-fetching
   - REST: Common issue
   - GraphQL: Client specifies needs

3. Versioning
   - REST: Explicit versions
   - GraphQL: Continuous evolution

### When to Use Each

**Choose REST when:**
- Simple CRUD operations
- Caching is priority
- Limited client requirements

**Choose GraphQL when:**
- Complex data relationships
- Multiple client platforms
- Bandwidth optimization needed
